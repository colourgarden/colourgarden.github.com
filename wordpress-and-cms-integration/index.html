<p>The majority of websites nowadays need to be updated. The frequency may change but the requirement is the same: unobstrusive and easy to use.</p>
<p>Over 60% of all websites are now built in <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and it has become an important social tool, granting anyone with a penchant for the pen their own blogging platform. I've been working with Wordpress for a number of years and am highly proficient when it comes to theme development and integration (I'm currently in the process of creating my first paid-for theme).</p>
<p><a href="http://pyrocms.com" target="_blank">Pyro</a> (PHP) and <a href="http://umbraco.com" target="_blank">Umbraco</a> (.Net, certified developer) are my other CMSs of choice for their abstracted data structures and simple templating languages. I also have experience integrating templates with many other content management systems including, but not limited to; SilverStripe, ExpressionEngine, SharePoint, Day CQ, Joomla, Drupal, Concrete5 and Magento. In addition, I've written and maintained bespoke applications built upon the <a href="http://codeigniter.com" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> and <a href="http://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel</a> PHP frameworks.</p>
