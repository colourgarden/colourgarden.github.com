<h2>Process and strategy</h2>

<p>With so many variables in terms of target audience, content gathering, design guidelines, front- and back-end development requirements, code deployment, visitor analysis and much more; for a developer, having the technical know-how is no longer enough.</p>
<p>Communication and cohesion are what make a group of talented individuals into a great team. And great teams make great products.</p>
<p>With a grounding in project management at the very beginning of my career, I advocate in-depth discussion at every milestone of every project I work on. Whether a comprehensive brief to kick-off, an effective handover from designer to developer, canvassing team members for ideas and approval or communicating a decision to a client.</p>
<p>I've worked with varied and agile web development and project management teams for some of the worldâ€™s largest companies and have contributed to the implementation of streamlined workflows. They say experience counts for everything.</p>
