<h2>Front end development</h2>
<h3>High-performance, modular code</h3>

<div class="feature-area feature-area--fed">

<p>More than any other aspect of web development, the pursuit of semantic HTML and scalable, modular CSS is an ever-changing goal.</p>
<p>With the expansion and adoption of rich Javascript interfaces and applications, the traditional remit of a front-end developer has crept wider and wider. The modern front-end developer requires a creative and expressive mind for user experience and also the logical nouse with which to construct efficient, lightweight and reusable code. Performance is king.</p>
<p>My current weapons of choice are the BEM- and OOCSS-based <a href="http://inuitcss.com" target="_blank">Inuit framework</a> with a measure of the <a href="http://bourbon.io" target="_blank">Bourbon</a> Sass library mixed in (to which I am a contributor). For Javascript development, I make use of the <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://zeptojs.com" target="_blank">Zepto</a> libraries as well as the <a href="http://meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a> framework (built on <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>) whilst attempting to keep plugins to a minimum.</p>
<p>However, the golden rule for any developer is to choose the correct tools for the job at hand.</p>
