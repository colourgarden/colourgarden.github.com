<p>The advent and subsequent explosion of internet-connected mobile devices has brought about a cultural and technological shift - both in the web industry and wider society - of gigantic proportions. A daunting yet exciting challenge.</p>
<p>Constructing user interfaces that work seamlessly across a dozen different browsers, for a half-dozen separate operating systems (and that's just the big boys) on an infinite number of screen resolutions requires an agile workflow and an intimate knowledge of the many web browser idiosycrasies.</p>
<p>And it's not all about the device. Serving mobile-optimised content - both in the form of readable copy and fast-loading visual assets - are key to providing a succinct and pleasurable user experience.</p>
