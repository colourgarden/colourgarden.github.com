    <p>‘Work’ for me is satisfying my curiosity; exploring every corner of the web. Whilst I enjoy developing with many different web technologies, my real passion is building beautiful, usable and high performance front-end interfaces.</p>
    <p>Since starting out as a fresh-faced teenager in 2006, I have worked with some of the world’s most prestigious brands, for some of the world’s most highly regarded agencies and have been able to travel the world in pursuit of front-end perfection. In the process, I have developed both an acute insight into what it means to build the very best web products and also the ability to execute innovative solutions using industry-leading techniques.</p>

<h3>And the rest...</h3>
<p>I pride myself on abstracting focus away from the obvious production tasks and identifying the real challenges and roadblocks in a web development project before they become a hindrance.</p>
<p>Early in my career I was exposed to many different facets of the web development process - from direct client contact to being chucked in at the deep end of application development - and I credit this as a major contributor to my confidence in ‘bridging the gaps’ between project management, design, front-end and back-end development.</p>
<p>A truly rounded web professional, not just a specialist front-end developer.</p>
<p>Away from the web industry, I’m a fervent football fan; supporting Liverpool and regularly attending Cambridge United matches as well as playing five-a-side twice a week.</p>
